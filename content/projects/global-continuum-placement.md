# Global Continuum Placement - PHYSICS EU Research Project

## Project Overview

This groundbreaking research project, developed within the context of the PHYSICS EU research initiative, addresses fundamental challenges in meta-scheduling for multi-cluster continuum computing. As Work Package 2 Lead, I'm driving innovation in distributed computing infrastructure that enables seamless workload placement across European edge computing resources.

**Impact**: Advancing European leadership in edge computing infrastructure through novel meta-scheduling algorithms and production-ready implementation.

## Research Context & EU Collaboration

- **Funding Program**: PHYSICS EU Research Project
- **Project Website**: physics-faas.eu
- **Work Package**: WP2 - Meta-scheduling on Multi-cluster Continuum
- **Role**: Work Package 2 Lead & Principal Developer
- **Duration**: 2021-2024 (3 years)
- **Consortium**: European research institutions and industry partners

## Technical Innovation

### Meta-Scheduling Architecture
The project develops advanced meta-scheduling algorithms that optimize workload placement across geographically distributed computing clusters. Our approach considers:

- **Resource Heterogeneity**: Adapting to diverse hardware configurations across edge locations
- **Network Topology**: Optimizing for varying connectivity patterns and latencies
- **Workload Characteristics**: Intelligent matching of application requirements to available resources
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Real-time adjustment to changing infrastructure conditions

### Production-Ready Implementation
Built with enterprise-grade Python technologies:

```python
# Meta-scheduling API with FastAPI
from dependency_injector import containers, providers
from aiohttp import web

class MetaScheduler:
    async def place_workload(self, requirements, available_clusters):
        """Optimize workload placement across continuum"""
        return await self.optimization_engine.solve(requirements, available_clusters)
```

### Key Technical Achievements
- **Scalability**: Handles scheduling decisions across 100+ edge locations
